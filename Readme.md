Necdromida's Dream
==================
Necdromida's Dream is a 2D old-school RPG game developed with SDL. In this game two heroes are asked to go into a wild zone and investigate what's going on there, where they find a nasty surprise. Through the world, the heroes must face random encounters in which they'll have to fight multiple enemies in a turn-based combat and eventually, level up, unlocking new skills.

This is the first game I developed and I'm uploading it by request of @xpander001.
